## 🧠 Project Description
Zenith Journal is an emotionally intelligent journaling web app that detects harmful thought patterns **while the user is writing** and gently intervenes before emotional spirals intensify.

Instead of analyzing emotions after writing, the system monitors behavioral and linguistic signals in real time and provides grounding, reframing, and breathing interventions.

---

## ❗ The Problem
Most mental wellness and journaling apps are passive — they help only **after** a person has already spiraled into distress.

People experiencing anxiety or rumination often:
- Repeat negative thoughts unconsciously
- Escalate emotions rapidly while writing
- Realize harmful thinking only after emotional damage

There is currently no tool that actively interrupts unhealthy thinking patterns **during the moment they happen**.

---

## 💡 The Solution
Zenith Journal continuously analyzes writing behavior and language patterns to detect cognitive distortions in real time.

When distress increases, the app intervenes using psychology-backed techniques:
- Reflection prompts at moderate distress
- Guided breathing cycle at high distress
- AI-generated gentle reframes after writing

The app acts like a thinking support companion — not just a diary.

## 🏗 System Architecture

Frontend (React)  
→ collects behavioral signals  
→ calculates intensity score  
→ sends entry to backend  

Backend (FastAPI)  
→ sends text to Groq LLM  
→ detects distortions  
→ returns reframing suggestions  

Database (MongoDB)  
→ stores journal entries and cognitive fingerprints
→ enables long-term pattern tracking
